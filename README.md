# Telecom Churn Prediction

As per [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate) - **Churn rate** (sometimes called **attrition rate**), in its broadest sense, is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support.

**Customer base churn:** Churn rate, when applied to a customer base, refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a supplier during a given time period. It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having to do with the customer life cycle.

It is more costly to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. For this reason, large telecommunications corporations are seeking to develop models to predict which customers are more likely to change and take actions accordingly.

The objective is to obtain a data-driven solution that will allow us to reduce churn rates and, as a consequence, to increase customer satisfaction and corporation revenue.

To predict how likely a customer will churn we will be analyzing following characteristics of the customers: 
1. demographic information 
2. account information
3. services information
